# Avastar

We need you to scale the project both in terms of infrastructure and security. There is a wide range of possible new cool features!

To understand more about the different Technical Challenges that the project is facing, please consult [this Notion page](https://avastar.notion.site/Technical-Challenges-0d8dcc660a1e436a9109b3e588c997d2).


## :bulb: Presentation

The goal of this webapp is to allow any internet user to upload his personal data retrieved from applications he uses and to make his digital identity clear and understandable through an automated dashboard.

⚠️ Facebook and Google are the only ones available for the moment, but the list of supported platforms is intended to grow.

## :rocket: Contributing
